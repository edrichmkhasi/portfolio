            <p>On December 1st 2019, I got hired at <a style="color: yellow" href="https://www.thedigitalacademy.co.za/#/web" target="blank">The Digital Academy</a>. "During the 6 month internship programme at The Digital Academy,
               Edrich and his team created a mobile application called <strong>Qub</strong>.
               <strong>Edrich</strong>â€™s main responsibilities on the project were creating the
               API by making use of Node JS and MongoDB as well as
               supporting the UI team when using React.
               I would have no hesitation in recommending Edrich as a Junior
               Developer. His technical foundation coupled with the desire to
               learn and continually improve would see him become an asset to
               any development team."</p>
